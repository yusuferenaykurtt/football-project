#  football-project

This repository was created as part of the **Akbank ML Bootcamp** and focuses on a supervised learning problem involving football player value prediction. The goal of the project is to train a machine learning model to predict a playerâ€™s market value based on various features such as physical attributes and skill ratings.

##  Introduction

This repository contains a `README.md` file explaining the project structure and background. We used a football dataset including players' physical and technical features. Throughout the project, we applied supervised learning techniques to estimate each player's value.

The technical implementation and explanations are provided inside the `.ipynb` notebook files using **Markdown cells**.

##  Metrics

After training the models, we evaluated performance using standard regression metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **RÂ² Score**

Each metric was interpreted to better understand the quality of predictions. Instead of just presenting numbers, we also discussed **what the results mean** and how the model could be improved.

##  Extras


 I didnâ€™t include GPU or Streamlit-based UI deployment in this version, this can be added later under a dedicated `ui/` folder.


---

##  Future Work

-  Add more features like injury history, transfer market trends, or performance stats.
-  Deploy the model via Streamlit or Gradio to create a user-friendly interface.
-  Automate model updates based on fresh player data scraped from online sources.
-  Test advanced models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, or deep learning frameworks.
-  Build a dashboard to visualize predictions and insights interactively.

## âœ… Final Note

This project was built during the bootcamp to showcase hands-on skills in data analysis, model development, and evaluation. The repository will remain active for future improvements and tracking progress in the field of machine learning.
