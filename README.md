# football-project

This repository has been created as part of the Akbank ML Bootcamp. It demonstrates a supervised learning project aimed at predicting football players' market values based on their attributes. The repository is made **public** as required and is structured in accordance with the bootcamp guidelines.

## Introduction

As you are currently reading, this is the required `README.md` file. Here, we provide brief information about the dataset used, the algorithms applied, and the goals of the project.

In addition to this explanation, technical insights are included within the `.ipynb` notebook files using Markdown cells. Simply including code cells without explanation is not sufficient; Markdown-based explanations are essential.

## Metrics

In this project, we trained various models and evaluated their performance using the following metrics:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R² Score

These metrics help us understand how well our models perform. Interpreting these results is also discussed in the notebook files.

## Extras

If you plan to go further with deployment or GPU usage (e.g., end-to-end or streamlit apps), you can document those here.

For example, if a UI folder or Streamlit app is included, mention its usage and how it can be deployed.

⚠️ **Note:** Your supervised and unsupervised notebooks must be separate. If you plan to do both, you'll need to upload each in its own file (e.g., `supervised.ipynb`, `unsupervised.ipynb`).

## Future Work and Improvements

This section is reserved for your vision of how the project might evolve in the future.

You can discuss:
- How this project could be improved further
- Adding real-time data or a front-end UI
- Using different machine learning models
- What new features can be engineered
- Technologies you'd like to learn more about for future improvements
