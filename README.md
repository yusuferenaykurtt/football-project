# Football Player Market Value Prediction

This project was developed as part of the Akbank Machine Learning Bootcamp. The aim of this project is to predict the market value of football players using supervised learning techniques.

## Introduction

The dataset contains physical, skill-based, and demographic attributes of players. We used regression algorithms to predict the players’ market value.

## Metrics

- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- R² (R-squared)

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Future Work

This project can be improved by trying advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM, adding more complex features, or applying ensemble methods.
